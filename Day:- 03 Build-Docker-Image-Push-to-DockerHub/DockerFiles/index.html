# Explanation:- 

This HTML file is a simple webpage that serves as a custom landing page. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of its structure and purpose:

### 1. Document Declaration

<!DOCTYPE html>

- Declares the document type as HTML5, ensuring the browser renders the webpage using the HTML5 standard.

### 2. <html> Tag

<html lang="en">

- The <html> element is the root of the HTML document.

  - The lang="en" attribute specifies that the document's language is English. 
  
  - This helps search engines and accessibility tools understand the language context.

### 3. <head> Section
  
The <head> section contains metadata and styling information for the webpage.

#### Meta Tags

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

  - charset="UTF-8": Ensures the document uses UTF-8 character encoding, supporting a wide range of characters and symbols.

  - viewport: Makes the page responsive by scaling it properly on different devices.

#### Title

<title>StackSimplify</title>

- Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab or search results.

#### Internal CSS

<style>
  body { 
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 
    text-align: center; 
    padding: 50px; 
    background-color: rgb(197, 144, 144);
  }
  h1 { font-size: 50px; }
  h2 { font-size: 40px; }
  h3 { font-size: 30px; }
  p { font-size: 20px; }
</style>

- Internal CSS styles define the appearance of the page:
 
  - body:
    
    - font-family: Arial, sans-serif; Sets the font for the entire page.
    - text-align: center: Centers all text horizontally.
    - padding: 50px: Adds space around the content.
    - background-color: rgb(197, 144, 144); Sets a light reddish background color.
 
  - Headings (h1, h2, h3):
    
      - Styles for each level of heading adjust their font sizes (50px, 40px, and 30px, respectively).
  
  - Paragraphs (p):
   
      - Font size is set to 20px for readability.

### 4. <body> Section

  The <body> contains the content that appears on the webpage.

#### Content Structure

<h1>Welcome to StackSimplify</h1>
<h2>Docker Image BUILD, RUN, TAG and PUSH to Docker Hub</h2>
<p>Learn technology through practical, real-world demos.</p>
<p>Application Version: v1</p>

- <h1>:

  - Displays the main heading: "Welcome to StackSimplify".
  - This is the most prominent text on the page, styled with font-size: 50px.

- <h2>:

  - A subheading that explains the purpose of the page: "Docker Image BUILD, RUN, TAG and PUSH to Docker Hub".

- <p> (Paragraphs):

    - Provides additional information:
    - "Learn technology through practical, real-world demos."
    - "Application Version: v1" specifies the application version.

### 5. Purpose of the Page

  - This HTML page is designed as a custom homepage for a Docker containerized application.
  - It serves as a demonstration of how to create and include a static webpage in a Docker container.
  - The styling and content highlight the purpose of the project: to teach Docker image management through practical examples.

### How It Works in the Docker Project

  1. The Dockerfile includes this index.html file and copies it to the Nginx container's web server directory (/usr/share/nginx/html).

  2. When the Nginx container runs, this webpage serves as the default landing page.

  3. By visiting the appropriate port (e.g., http://localhost:8090), users see this customized page instead of the default Nginx page.

### Customizations
  
You can modify:

  - Text content: Change the headings, and paragraphs, or add additional content.

  - CSS styles: Adjust colors, fonts, or layout to match branding requirements.

  - HTML structure: Add more sections, images, or links to make the page more functional.
